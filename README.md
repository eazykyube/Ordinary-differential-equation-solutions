# Ordinary differential equation solutions

Implementation of Euler method, Improved Euler method and Runge Kutta method for solving for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value. Was implemented with JFrame library for minimal visual representation of the data. Was done as an assignment within Linear Algebra course of Innopolis University.
